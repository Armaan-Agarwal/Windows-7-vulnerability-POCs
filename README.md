# System Security Testing with Metasploit

This repository contains documentation and scripts for testing system security using the Metasploit tool from Kali Linux to exploit vulnerabilities in Windows XP and Windows 7 machines. The objective is to demonstrate potential security risks and recommend security patches to mitigate such vulnerabilities.

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical. Ensure that you have explicit permission before conducting any security testing on systems that you do not own or operate.

## Setup

1. **Hacker Machine:** Kali Linux
2. **Victim Machine:** Windows XP / Windows 7

Ensure you have both the hacker machine (Kali Linux) and the victim machine (Windows XP / Windows 7) set up in your testing environment.

## Usage

1. Launch Kali Linux on your hacker machine.
2. Open Metasploit by executing the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    msfconsole
    ```
3. Identify and select the exploit suitable for the target Windows version (XP or 7).
4. Set the necessary options for the selected exploit, such as the target IP address and payload.
5. Execute the exploit to gain access to the victim machine.
6. Once access is gained, execute commands to extract keystrokes, capture screenshots, access the webcam, etc.

## Reporting

After performing the tests, it's essential to document the vulnerabilities discovered along with the steps taken to exploit them. Include screenshots to illustrate the process and its outcomes effectively.

### Vulnerability Report Structure

1. **Introduction**: Brief overview of the testing objectives and methods used.
2. **Vulnerability Identification**: List of vulnerabilities discovered during testing.
3. **Exploitation Techniques**: Detailed explanation of how each vulnerability was exploited.
4. **Screenshots**: Visual documentation of the exploitation process.
5. **Recommendations**: Suggestions for security patches or measures to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.

## Security Recommendations

Based on the vulnerabilities discovered during testing, implement the following security measures to avoid similar attacks:

1. **Regular System Updates**: Ensure that all operating systems and software are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
2. **Firewall Configuration**: Configure firewalls on Windows machines to block unauthorized access.
3. **Antivirus Software**: Install and regularly update antivirus software to detect and prevent malware infections.
4. **User Education**: Train users to recognize and avoid suspicious emails, links, and downloads.
5. **Network Segmentation**: Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a potential breach.
